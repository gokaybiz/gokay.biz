Hi! I'm GÃ¶kay Mehmet Biz. My passion for softwares started early at 13, I launched my first blog, experimenting with code, the internet, and anything tech I could get my hands on. That curiosity has only grown stronger over the years.

Today, I'm a Fullstack Developer based in Stockholm, Sweden. For over four years, I've been building and optimizing web applications and comprehensive databases, especially for scientific research. I've contributed to international projects, co-authored publications, and enjoyed collaborating with diverse teams.

## What Do I Do?

- Develop modern web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue/React, Django, Node.js, Python, GoLang, SQL/NoSQL and more.
- Work with large datasets, focusing on performance optimization and user experience.
- Skilled in DevOps and cloud solutions (GCP, VPS Managament, Docker).

## Who Am I?

- Always eager to learn and explore new technologies.
- Believe in teamwork, sharing knowledge, and open communication.
- Value clean, maintainable, and readable code as much as working solutions.
- See mistakes as opportunities to grow and never shy away from trying new things.

## Why Do I Write?

Writing helps me solidify what I learn and share it with others. On my blog, I continue to post about both technical topics and personal experiences, inform, or just connect with fellow curious minds.

I'm here to keep learning, building, and sharing. See you around!
